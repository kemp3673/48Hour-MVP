## Description
  The app aims to be a useful tool for all Dungeon Masters that find themselves lugging around too many books and other materials. The app long term version to be all included resource that contains monster information, ability to track player information, and contain useful rule references such as status conditions and equipment information
  
  ### Future Desires
   Currently the app is in a very basic version. It heavily relies on outside sources for its references which I wish to store in app later in order to give the app the ability to run with no internet connection. Aditionally, I would like to add a random name generator that can be specified by race and gender if desired. I had tried to implement a 3D dice roller (the reason the center of the app is empty) but I was unable to accomplish that within the tight time frame I had. That is something that is a must have for me down the road. The app needs to also get a better spotify embedded player that lets the user change playlists. Currently it only plays an album that is input within the spotify.js file. Last, I would like to implement a local note taking and tracking feature instead of linking to outside sources. 
    
   On the back-end of things credential autorization is a feature I greatly desire and want to implement session storage so users can open the app and have all the information there as they left it.
